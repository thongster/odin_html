    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Thịt Kho Tiêu is a classic Vietnamese comfort dish made with pork braised slowly in a savory-sweet caramel sauce with plenty of black pepper. Unlike the festive version with eggs, this everyday version focuses on the tender, flavorful pork. The sauce balances salty fish sauce, a touch of sweetness, and the warmth of pepper. It’s simple to prepare and pairs perfectly with steamed jasmine rice and fresh vegetables.</p>
    <p>This dish is loved for its rich, glossy caramelized flavor and how easily it comes together with just a few pantry staples. It’s a staple in many Vietnamese households.</p>
