    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Canh Chua is a refreshing Vietnamese sweet and sour soup, often made with fish, tamarind, pineapple, and a mix of herbs and vegetables. The broth is light yet flavorful, balancing sourness from tamarind, sweetness from pineapple, and savoriness from fish sauce.</p>
    <p>It’s a signature dish in Southern Vietnam, often enjoyed alongside caramelized dishes like Cá Kho Tộ or Thịt Kho. Canh Chua is typically served with rice and is known for being both comforting and palate-cleansing.</p>
