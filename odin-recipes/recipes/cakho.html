    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Cá Kho Tộ is a classic Southern Vietnamese dish featuring fish braised in a clay pot with a savory-sweet caramel sauce. Traditionally made with catfish, the dish develops rich flavor as the fish slowly simmers with fish sauce, sugar, garlic, and black pepper. The clay pot helps concentrate the flavors and gives the dish its signature taste, but a regular pot works too.</p>
    <p>It’s usually served with steamed jasmine rice, fresh vegetables, and sometimes a side of soup. The tender, flavorful fish coated in glossy caramel sauce is a staple comfort food in many Vietnamese households.</p>
